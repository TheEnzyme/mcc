Meta C/C++ compiler

This project provides a method of generating a C/C++ project's files by specifiying it's structure in a text file.
This is achieved through a combination of flex and bison, to create a scanner and parser for the text format.
Examples will be added eventually, as well as documentation. Hopefully.

TODO:
* Header guards
* Classes
* Functions
* Constructors/Deconstructor
* Structs?
* Enums?
